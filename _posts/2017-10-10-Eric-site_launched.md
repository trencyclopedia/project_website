Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
By following the instructions from Jonathan McGlone, I was able to set up my first website on GitHub based on Jekyll. Hope everything will work. My figures are crossed. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
